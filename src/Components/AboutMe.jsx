                <hr/>
                <p>
                    My relentless curiosity in what concerns the realm of all
                    digital related stuff has made me dive head-on into the
                    study of Electronics && Telecommunications. I got acquainted
                    with the many layers of computing - from the constant flow
                    of electrons that activate devices, to the complex
                    functioning of the operating system that organizes their
                    tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, also trained as a Full-Stack Developer, I have added to
                    my skillset the ability to write scalable && clean code as
                    well as to deploy insanely awesome solutions to all kinds of
                    software problems. I am now able to tackle bugs at multiple
                    levels, whether they breed within the electronic components
                    of the machine or amidst lines of code on my IDE.
                </p>
